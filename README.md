# Throwback Trivia - Group Project

## Learning Goals and Skills Acquired

This project allowed us to strengthen our knowledge in working with OOP, classes and JS fundamentals as well as continue our practice in TDD. We utilized iterator and mutator methods to manipulate our game data. We also implemented a more efficient GitHub workflow.

## New Technologies

* fetch API
* Sass / SCSS

## Features

The users must enter their names to and click the "Submit" button to start the game. They will click on any box and answer the question presented. If the guess is correct, their score will increment by the point value of the question chosen; if incorrect, scores will decrease by that value. The next player then picks a question to attempt. Hidden at random in the board is a "Daily Double" question for which the player receives double the amount of the point value associated with that question.
